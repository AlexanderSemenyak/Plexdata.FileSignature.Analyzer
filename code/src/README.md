## Project Build

Best way to build the whole project is to use _Visual Studio 2019 Community_. Thereafter, download the 
complete sources, open the solution file `FileSignatureAnalyzer.sln`, switch to release and rebuild all.

## Help Generation

The source code help or better the API documentation has been generated manually using 
[Sandcastle Help File Builder](https://ewsoftware.github.io/SHFB/html/bd1ddb51-1c4f-434f-bb1a-ce2135d3a909.htm) 
and is available as [Wiki](https://github.com/akesseler/Plexdata.FileSignature.Analyzer/wiki).

## Trouble Shooting

Nothing known at the moment.
